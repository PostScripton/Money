# 🧰 Upgrade guide from `3.x` to `4.x`

## PHP and Laravel versions
- PHP: `^8.1`
- Laravel: `9`

This version drops support of PHP < 8.1 and now supports Laravel 9.
This was made in order to keep pace with new versions and use new features.

### Extensions

- `bcmath` Now used for all calculations to be as accurate as possible.

## 📈 Raising precision

The main purpose of this update was to raise the precision of monetary objects.

It was decided to use only `string` as a representation of money due to large numbers are being stored, therefore these amounts were raised up to **4 decimal places**.

For example, the following `102500` stands for `10.25`. 

### 📦 Migrations

⚠️ **WARN**: before running any migration, make sure you installed the [`doctrine/dbal`](https://github.com/doctrine/dbal) package.

#### If you've used `integer` origin

That's good if you heeded Uncle Bob's advice: don't use floating point numbers to represent monetary amounts.

```php
// Adjust these constants for your needs.
// DECIMALS is the value that is set in the config file (the value that was before).
// TABLES is an array of tables you need to change in.
// A key represents a table name and a value (array) represents needed columns for the change.
private const DECIMALS = 1;
private const TABLES = [
    'users' => ['balance'],
    'products' => ['min_price', 'price'],
];

public function up(): void
{
    foreach (self::TABLES as $tableName => $columns) {    
        $lackingDecimalPlaces = 4 - self::DECIMALS;
        if ($lackingDecimalPlaces > 0) {
            $multiplier = 10 ** $lackingDecimalPlaces;

                            return [$column => DB::raw("$column * $multiplier")];
                        })
                        ->toArray()
                );
        }

        Schema::table($tableName, function (Blueprint $table) use ($columns) {
            foreach ($columns as $column) {
                $table->bigInteger($column)->default(0)->change();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

</details>

#### If you've used `float` origin

Unfortunately, there is a lot of work to do here. However, I've spent some time to write a migration for you, but you still need to do a manual stuff in the code.

                $table->decimal($column, 20, 4)->default(0)->change();
            }

                        return [$column => DB::raw("$column * $multiplier")];
                    })
                    ->toArray(),
            );

        Schema::table($tableName, function (Blueprint $table) use ($columns) {
            foreach ($columns as $column) {
                $table->bigInteger($column)->default(0)->change();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### 🛡 Responsibility

Please note that you are responsible for the correctness of the migration.
Check several times yourself locally.

If you find any vulnerability or idea for improvement in any migration, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/PostScripton/laravel-money/issues/new).

### Origins

Origins were completely removed from this library, so if you use them anywhere, you must clean up every single place where it's been used.

❌ The property `origin` was removed from the config file.

❌ The following methods were **removed** from `MoneySettings`:
- `setOrigin()`
- `getOrigin()`

❌ The ORIGIN constants were removed:
- `ORIGIN_INT`
- `ORIGIN_FLOAT`

❌ The exception `UndefinedOriginException` was removed.

❌ The following method was **removed** from `Money`:
- `upload()`

🟧 The following methods no longer accept number and origin as their first and second arguments, respectively.

- [`add()`](/docs/04_money/object/add.md)
- [`lessThan()`](/docs/04_money/object/lessThan.md)
- [`lessThanOrEqual()`](/docs/04_money/object/lessThanOrEqual.md)
- [`greaterThan()`](/docs/04_money/object/greaterThan.md)
- [`greaterThanOrEqual()`](/docs/04_money/object/greaterThanOrEqual.md)
- [`rebase()`](/docs/04_money/object/rebase.md)
- [`subtract()`](/docs/04_money/object/subtract.md)

Now they have only one argument (another monetary object).

❌ **NO LONGER:**
```php
use PostScripton\Money\MoneySettings;

$m1 = money('100000');

$m1->add(200, MoneySettings::ORIGIN_INT)
```

✅ **ONLY WAY:**
```php
$m1 = money('1000000');

$m1->add(money('2000000'));
```

---

😔 Unfortunately, you have to check all usages manually and adjust them so that they can accept only a monetary object as their first argument, and don't use `origin` word.

### Money constructors

All money construct methods:

- `new Money()`
- `Money::of()`
- `money()`

now accept only `string` as their first argument.

## Enums

When the package migrated to PHP 8.1, the enums became available.

### 🟩 `CurrencyDisplay`

- ❌ `Currency::DISPLAY_SYMBOL` => 🟩 `CurrencyDisplay::Symbol`
- ❌ `Currency::DISPLAY_CODE` => 🟩 `CurrencyDisplay::Code`

### 🟩 `CurrencyList`

- `CurrencyList::All`
- `CurrencyList::Popular`
- `CurrencyList::Custom`

### 🟩 `CurrencyPosition`

- ❌ `Currency::POSITION_START` => 🟩 `CurrencyPosition::Start`
- ❌ `Currency::POSITION_END` => 🟩 `CurrencyPosition::End`

## Config

### Enums instead of constants

1. In the `currency_list` setting change a _string_ on its **enum** equivalent `CurrencyList`
2. In the `custom_currencies` setting change a _position-constant_ on its **enum** equivalent `CurrencyPosition`

### Formatting

Put your formatting settings inside of `formatting` key.

❌ **Before**

```php
'thousands_separator' => ' ',
'decimal_separator' => '.',
'decimals' => 1,
'ends_with_0' => false,
'space_between' => true,
```

```php
config('money.thousands_separator');
```

✅ **After**

```php
'formatting' => [
    'thousands_separator' => ' ',
    'decimal_separator' => '.',
    'decimals' => 1,
    'ends_with_0' => false,
    'space_between' => true,
],
```

```php
config('money.formatting.thousands_separator');
```

### Rate exchangers

Replace `service` and `services` with `rate_exchanger` and `rate_exchangers` correspondingly.

⚠️ `exchangeratesapi` is replaced with `fixer`.

❌ **Before**

```php
'service' => 'exchangerate',

'services' => [
    'exchangeratesapi' => [
        // https://exchangeratesapi.io/
        'class' => \PostScripton\Money\Services\ExchangeRatesAPIService::class,
        'key' => env('EXCHANGERATESAPI_API_KEY'),
        'secure' => env('EXCHANGERATESAPI_SECURE', false),
        'base_restriction' => env('EXCHANGERATESAPI_BASE_RESTRICTION', true),
    ],
    'openexchangerates' => [
        // https://openexchangerates.org/
        'class' => \PostScripton\Money\Services\OpenExchangeRatesService::class,
        'key' => env('OPENEXCHANGERATES_API_KEY'),
        'base_restriction' => env('OPENEXCHANGERATES_BASE_RESTRICTION', true),
    ],
    'exchangerate' => [
        // https://exchangerate.host/
        'class' => \PostScripton\Money\Services\ExchangeRateService::class,
    ],
],
```

✅ **After**

```php
'rate_exchanger' => 'exchangerate',

'rate_exchangers' => [

    'fixer' => [
        // https://fixer.io/
        'class' => \PostScripton\Money\Clients\RateExchangers\Fixer::class,
        'key' => env('FIXER_API_KEY'),
        'free_plan' => env('FIXER_FREE_PLAN', true),
    ],

    'openexchangerates' => [
        // https://openexchangerates.org/
        'class' => \PostScripton\Money\Clients\RateExchangers\OpenExchangeRates::class,
        'key' => env('OPENEXCHANGERATES_API_KEY'),
    ],

    'exchangerate' => [
        // https://exchangerate.host/
        'class' => \PostScripton\Money\Clients\RateExchangers\ExchangeRate::class,
    ],

],
```

### Cache

There's new settings for caching:

```php
'cache' => [
    'enabled' => env('MONEY_CACHE_ENABLED', true),    
    
    'store' => 'default',
    
    'rate_exchanger' => [
        // Request to get all supported currencies by rate exchanger.
        'supports' => [
            'ttl' => \DateInterval::createFromDateString('7 days'), // or `null` to store forever
        ],

        // Request to get a real-time exchange rates. Historical rates are stored forever.
        'rate' => [
            'ttl' => \DateInterval::createFromDateString('1 hour'), // or `null` to store forever
        ],
    ],
],
```

## Money

### 🟧 Constructor

There are several breaking changes in the constructor behavior:

1. No settings in the constructor as third argument
2. Accepts only string-integers, otherwise throws exception `InvalidArgumentException`
3. Trims all decimals. Only integers (as strings) are used to represent amount

### ❌ `getPureAmount()`, 🟧 `getAmount()`

The `getPureAmount()` method has been removed, and `getAmount()` now works as the previous one worked.

```php
// 3.x =========================

$money = money('12345000');

$money->getPureAmount();    // "12345000"
$money->getAmount();        // "1 234.5"

// 4.x =========================

$money = money('12345000');

$money->getAmount();            // "12345000"
$money->toAmountOnlyString();   // "1 234.5"
```

### ❌ `Money::getDefaultCurrency()`, `Money::setDefaultCurrency()`

These methods were moved to the `Currency` class.

```php
use PostScripton\Money\Currency;

Currency::getDefault();
Currency::setDefault(currency('RUB'));
```

### ❌ `Money::correctInput()`

The method has been removed due to [vote results](https://github.com/PostScripton/laravel-money/discussions/99) on GitHub because no one voted. 

### 🟧 `multiple()`

This method has been renamed to `multiply()` in order to be grammatically correct.

Whenever you use it, you can take advantage of your IDE to replace this everywhere.
Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`R`, select `Match case` and `Words` options, and replace all `multiple(` with `multiply(`. But first, check all found occurrences out.

### 🟧 `multiply()`

In order not to stray from the previous change,
this method now accepts `string` instead of `float`.

It's very important because unexpected behavior may occur.

```php
$money->multiply('1.5');    // use this
$money->multiply(1.5);      // instead of this
```

### 🟧 `divide()`

This method now accepts `string` instead of `float`.

It's very important because unexpected behavior may occur.

```php
$money->divide('1.5');  // use this
$money->divide(1.5);    // instead of this
```

### 🟧 `isEmpty()`

This method has been renamed to `isZero()`.

### 🟧 `lessThan()`

Now throws `MoneyHasDifferentCurrenciesException` when `$money` argument has a different currency.

### 🟧 `lessThanOrEqual()`

Now throws `MoneyHasDifferentCurrenciesException` when `$money` argument has a different currency.

### 🟧 `greaterThan()`

Now throws `MoneyHasDifferentCurrenciesException` when `$money` argument has a different currency.

### 🟧 `greaterThanOrEqual()`

Now throws `MoneyHasDifferentCurrenciesException` when `$money` argument has a different currency.

### 🟧 `equals()`

The method was reworked. It no longer compares objects via `===` and `==` operators.

Now, with `strict` flag it compares not only amounts, but also currencies of monetary objects.

### 🟧 `difference()`

This method no longer returns string, instead it returns a new monetary object.
The doesn't accept settings as its second parameter as well.

The important thing is, the `difference()` method returns an **absolute** amount.

```php
use PostScripton\Money\Money;

$m1 = Money::parse('$ 25');
$m2 = Money::parse('$ 100');

// Before
$m3 = $m1->difference($m2); // "$ -75" (string)

// After
$m3 = $m1->difference($m2); // $ 75 (Money)
```

### 🟧 `convertInto()`

The signature of this method changed as following:

1. `convertTo(Currency|string $to, ?Carbon $date = null): Money`
2. `offlineConvertTo(Currency|string $currency, string $rate): Money`

### 🟧 `Money::make()`

The method was renamed to `Money::of()`, the rest is the same.

### 🟧 `Money::parse()`

Now you need to help a parser to recognize a currency by providing a code (`USD`/`840`) as the second parameter.
However, if only first parameter is passed, it will take the `default_currency` from the config file.

### 🟧 `Money::getDefaultDivisor()`

This method now always returns `10.000` (10 powered by 4 decimal places)

### 🟩 `setCurrency()`

The method was extracted from settings and moved here.

## ❌ MoneySettings

One of the most important things of this update is replacement MoneySettings with MoneyFormatter.

Now formatters are used in order to format (display) monetary objects.

👀 See [here](/docs/02_formatting/README.md) for full details about new formatters.

### ❌ `settings()`

The helper for creating new settings instance was removed,
because of the reason that has been mentioned above.

### ❌ `bind()`, `unbind()`, `bound()`

These methods were removed completely because of [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/PostScripton/laravel-money/issues/45).

### ❌ `getCurrency()`, `setCurrency()`

These methods were extracted directly from settings into Money.

### Exceptions

Most exceptions were reworked completely and some of them were removed.

- ❌ `CustomCurrencyWrongFieldTypeException`
- ❌ `CustomCurrencyDoesNotHaveFieldException`

## Currency

### Currency list

It was decided to get rid of methods for setting a currency list from the code. From now on, it is still available for setting only from the config file.

- ❌ `Currency::currentList()`
- ❌ `Currency::setCurrencyList()`
- ❌ `Currency::isIncorrectList()`

### ❌ Constants

All constants were replaced with enum equivalents.

See above in the `Enums` section.

### ❌ `Currency::getConfigCurrencyCode()`

Use `Currency::getDefault()` instead only if you don't override it with `Currency::setDefault()`.

If you need to use exactly default currency from the config file,
then use `config('money.default_currency')`

### 🟧 `Currency::getCurrencies()`

This method has been moved to [`Currencies` class](/docs/03_currencies/collection_methods.md):

- `Currencies::get()`
- `Currencies::getCodesArray()`

## ❌ Services

Services have been refactored to RateExchangers. Those are used inside of `convertTo()` method.

👀 See [here](/docs/05_rate_exchangers/README.md#access-to-rateexchanger-instance) for full details.

## Exceptions

Most exceptions were refactored, some united and some removed.
Several ones adjusted messages a little.

- 🟩 `RateExchangerException` - this one united several exceptions into itself:
  - ❌ `ServiceException`
  - ❌ `ServiceClassDoesNotExistException`
  - ❌ `ServiceDoesNotExistException`
  - ❌ `ServiceDoesNotHaveClassException`
  - ❌ `ServiceDoesNotInheritServiceException`
  - ❌ `ServiceDoesNotSupportCurrencyException`
- 🟧 These are replaced with the standard `Exception`:
  - ❌ `ShouldPublishConfigFileException`
  - ❌ `WrongParserStringException`
- 🟧 These are replaced with the standard `InvalidArgumentException`:
  - ❌ `CustomCurrencyValidationException`
