# 🧰 Upgrade guide from `3.x` to `4.x`

## PHP and Laravel versions
- PHP: `^8.1`
- Laravel: `9`

This version drops support of PHP < 8.1 and now supports Laravel 9.
This was made in order to keep pace with new versions and use new features.

## Methods

### `multiple()`

This method has been renamed to `multiply()` in order to be grammatically correct.

Whenever you use it, you can take advantage of your IDE to replace this everywhere.
Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`R`, select `Match case` and `Words` options, and replace all `multiple(` with `multiply(`. But first, check all found occurrences out.

### These are now accepts only a monetary objects

The following methods no longer accept number and origin as their first and second arguments, respectively.

- [`add()`](/docs/04_money/object/add.md)
- [`lessThan()`](/docs/04_money/object/lessThan.md)
- [`lessThanOrEqual()`](/docs/04_money/object/lessThanOrEqual.md)
- [`greaterThan()`](/docs/04_money/object/greaterThan.md)
- [`greaterThanOrEqual()`](/docs/04_money/object/greaterThanOrEqual.md)
- [`rebase()`](/docs/04_money/object/rebase.md)
- [`subtract()`](/docs/04_money/object/subtract.md)

Now they have only one argument (another monetary object).

❌ **NO LONGER:**
```php
use PostScripton\Money\MoneySettings;

$m1 = money(100);

$m1->add(100, MoneySettings::ORIGIN_INT)
```

✅ **ONLY WAY:**
```php
$m1 = money(100);
$m2 = money(200);

$m1->add($m2);
```

😔 Unfortunately, you have to check all the uses manually and adjust them so that they can accept only a monetary object as their first argument.
