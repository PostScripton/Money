# 🧰 Upgrade guide from `3.x` to `4.x`

## PHP and Laravel versions
- PHP: `^8.1`
- Laravel: `9`

This version drops support of PHP < 8.1 and now supports Laravel 9.
This was made in order to keep pace with new versions and use new features.

## 📈 Raising precision

The main purpose of this update was to raise the precision of monetary objects.

It was decided to use only `string` as a representation of money due to large numbers are being stored, therefore these amounts were raised up to **4 decimal places**.

For example, the following `102500` stands for `10.25`. 

### 📦 Migrations

⚠️ **WARN**: before running any migration, make sure you installed the `doctrine/dbal` package.

#### If you've used `integer` origin

That's good if you heeded Uncle Bob's advice: don't use floating point numbers to represent monetary amounts.

```php
// Adjust these constants for your needs.
// DECIMALS is the value that is set in the config file (the value that was before).
// TABLES is an array of tables you need to change in.
// A key represents a table name and a value (array) represents needed columns for the change.
private const DECIMALS = 1;
private const TABLES = [
    'users' => ['balance'],
    'products' => ['min_price', 'price'],
];

public function up(): void
{
    foreach (self::TABLES as $tableName => $columns) {    
        $lackingDecimalPlaces = 4 - self::DECIMALS;
        if ($lackingDecimalPlaces > 0) {
            $multiplier = 10 ** $lackingDecimalPlaces;

                            return [$column => DB::raw("$column * $multiplier")];
                        })
                        ->toArray()
                );
        }

        Schema::table($tableName, function (Blueprint $table) use ($columns) {
            foreach ($columns as $column) {
                $table->bigInteger($column)->default(0)->change();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### If you've used `float` origin

Unfortunately, there is a lot of work to do here. However, I've spent some time to write a migration for you, but you still need to do a manual stuff in the code.

// Adjust this constant for your needs.

// A key represents a table name and a value (array) represents needed columns for the change.

    foreach (self::TABLES as $tableName => $columns) {
        Schema::table($tableName, function (Blueprint $table) use ($columns) {
            foreach ($columns as $column) {
                // WARNING: make sure the largest amount (in one of the columns) is not greater than 16 digits,
                // otherwise increase the decimal parameters (20 and 4)
                $table->decimal($column, 20, 4)->default(0)->change();
            }
        });

        $multiplier = 10 ** 4;
        DB::table($tableName)
            ->update(
                collect($columns)
                    ->mapWithKeys(function (string $column) use ($multiplier) {
                        return [$column => DB::raw("$column * $multiplier")];
                    })
                    ->toArray(),
            );

        Schema::table($tableName, function (Blueprint $table) use ($columns) {
            foreach ($columns as $column) {
                $table->bigInteger($column)->default(0)->change();
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### 🛡 Responsibility

Please note that you are responsible for the correctness of the migration.
Check several times yourself locally.

If you find any vulnerability or idea for improvement in any migration, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/PostScripton/laravel-money/issues/new).

### Origins

Origins were completely removed from this library, so if you use them anywhere, you must clean up every single place where it's been used.

❌ The property `origin` was removed from the config file.

❌ The following methods were **removed** from `MoneySettings`:
- `setOrigin()`
- `getOrigin()`

❌ The ORIGIN constants were removed:
- `ORIGIN_INT`
- `ORIGIN_FLOAT`

❌ The exception `UndefinedOriginException` was removed.

❌ The following method was **removed** from `Money`:
- `upload()`

🟧 The method `getDefaultDivisor()` now always returns `10.000` (10 powered by 4 decimal places)

🟧 The following methods no longer accept number and origin as their first and second arguments, respectively.

- [`add()`](/docs/04_money/object/add.md)
- [`lessThan()`](/docs/04_money/object/lessThan.md)
- [`lessThanOrEqual()`](/docs/04_money/object/lessThanOrEqual.md)
- [`greaterThan()`](/docs/04_money/object/greaterThan.md)
- [`greaterThanOrEqual()`](/docs/04_money/object/greaterThanOrEqual.md)
- [`rebase()`](/docs/04_money/object/rebase.md)
- [`subtract()`](/docs/04_money/object/subtract.md)

Now they have only one argument (another monetary object).

❌ **NO LONGER:**
```php
use PostScripton\Money\MoneySettings;

$m1 = money('100000');

$m1->add(200, MoneySettings::ORIGIN_INT)
```

✅ **ONLY WAY:**
```php
$m1 = money('1000000');

$m1->add(money('2000000'));
```

---

😔 Unfortunately, you have to check all usages manually and adjust them so that they can accept only a monetary object as their first argument, and don't use `origin` word.

### Money constructors

All money construct methods:

- `new Money()`
- `Money::of()`
- `money()`

now accept only `string` as their first argument.

## Enums

When the package migrated to PHP 8.1, the enums became available.

### 🟩 `CurrencyDisplay`

### 🟩 `CurrencyList`

### 🟩 `CurrencyPosition`

## Money

### 🟧 `multiple()`

This method has been renamed to `multiply()` in order to be grammatically correct.

Whenever you use it, you can take advantage of your IDE to replace this everywhere.
Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`R`, select `Match case` and `Words` options, and replace all `multiple(` with `multiply(`. But first, check all found occurrences out.

### 🟧 `equals()`

The method was reworked. It no longer compares objects via `===` and `==` operators.

Now, with `strict` flag it compares not only amounts, but also currencies of monetary objects.

### 🟧 `Money::make()`

The method was renamed to `Money::of()`, the rest is the same.

### 🟩 `setCurrency()`

The method was extracted from settings and moved here.

## MoneySettings

### ❌ `bind()`, `unbind()`, `bound()`

These methods were removed completely because of [Garbage Collection](https://github.com/PostScripton/laravel-money/issues/45).

### ❌ `getCurrency()`, `setCurrency()`

These methods were extracted directly from settings into Money.

### Exceptions

Most exceptions were reworked completely and some of them were removed.

- ❌ `CustomCurrencyWrongFieldTypeException`
- ❌ `CustomCurrencyDoesNotHaveFieldException`

## Currency

### Currency list

It was decided to get rid of methods for setting a currency list from the code. From now on, it is still available for setting only from the config file.

- ❌ `Currency::currentList()`
- ❌ `Currency::setCurrencyList()`
- ❌ `Currency::isIncorrectList()`

### 🟧 `Currency::getCurrencies()`

This method has been moved to [`Currencies` class](/docs/03_currencies/get_currencies.md):

- `Currencies::get()`
- `Currencies::getCodesArray()`
