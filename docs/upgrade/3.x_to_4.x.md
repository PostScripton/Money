# ðŸ§° Upgrade guide from `3.x` to `4.x`

## PHP and Laravel versions
- PHP: `^8.1`
- Laravel: `9`

This version drops support of PHP < 8.1 and now supports Laravel 9.
This was made in order to keep pace with new versions and use new features.

## Methods

### `multiple()`

This method has been renamed to `multiply()` in order to be grammatically correct.

Whenever you use it, you can take advantage of your IDE to replace this everywhere.
Press `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`R`, select `Match case` and `Words` options, and replace all `multiple(` with `multiply(`. But first, check all found occurrences out.
