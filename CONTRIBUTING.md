# ü§≤ Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/PostScripton/laravel-money/).

## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-2 Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to use [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) just by running:
    - ```bash
      composer app:check-build
      ```
    - ```bash
      composer app:cs-fix
      ```
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- Create feature branches - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per a feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests. Features must be atomic, that is, do not contain unnecessary things.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

## Security

If you discover any security-related issues, please email [postscripton.sp@gmail.com](mailto:postscripton.sp@gmail.com) instead of using the issue tracker.

## Wishes

We would be really pleased if you considered helping us with:
1. **A brand-new name of the library in one word**. At the same time it has to make sense, be meaningful.
   For example, [Carbon](https://carbon.nesbot.com/) sounds quite good.
